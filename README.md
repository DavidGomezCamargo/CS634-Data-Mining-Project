# House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques
Interpretable Gradient Boosting - Real Estate House Price Prediction
### Description <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques">Docker Desktop for Windows</a>
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.
With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

Hyperparameters tuning with Optuna of the LightGBM model. Created a streamlit app for the house price prediction problem. Streamlit is a python library that allows you to create web apps with minimal coding and deploy them in the cloud. Deployed the streamlit app in HuggingFace streamlit spaces with a SHAP summary plot and a SHAP interaction plot. Link to the deployed <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/DavidGomezCamargo/demo_app">HF space</a> where the Milestone 2 calculation and the optimized app calculation price prediction can both be seen.
